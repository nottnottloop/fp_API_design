# fp_API_design
looks like SQL will work

schema: people and houses

people: name, age, number of cohabitants, house iD

house: house ID, owner, postcode and address

API should handle get requests for this data for people and houses. as well as using joins

website.com/people and website.com/houses

content types will be json or whatever format is best to export from the SQL database
